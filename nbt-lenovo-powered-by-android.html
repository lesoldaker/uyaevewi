Problem is though, the first image is not a part of the animation, its somewhere else in the system. So, even though I have a custom bootanimation.zip, it still shows "Lenovo, powered by android" while loading before the animation actually starts. Where might I find that Ione system image.

I know this is hella weird, and I don't understand how and why it happened but it did: Had my phone connected to my PC, wanted to deleted the contents of my Music folder (all MP3s) so that afterwards I could copy my newer music library on my PC over to my phone. So through my PC, I select the contents of the folder and try to delete it - and my phone rebooted (twice, too). I though it was weird, but tried again and same thing happened. So then I tried to delete. Более десяти лет назад в мире техники появился очень интересный проект – телефон с проектором. Are you a freshman? Heading off to college?

# Mediatek MT8173 & MT8176 development Hi folks, after I've long been working on my device and only made little progress in building LineageOS for my Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 I decided to look for other developers with similar devices. My Mi Pad 3 \(codename: cappu\) is a tablet based on a Mediatek MT8176 SoC. It was launched in April 2017. The tablet comes with a 7.9" display with a resolution of 2048 pixels by 1536 pixels at a PPI of 326 pixels per inch. It is powered by a 2.1GHz/1.7GHz Добро пожаловать на Технический форум.

While both were GREAT devices, and iOS is a certainly a supremely optimized, polished mobile ecosystem, it does not play well with Windows PC. I could have ditched my perfectly good Asus i3 (6th.

I'm wanting to play fallout 4 on it and I know there are apps that would allow you to play stream VR games to Android phones, as a way around the Vive and Rift.

Each phone is formatted similar: starting with it's name (and a link to an in-depth spec sheet), carriers and cost, followed by a (somewhat) brief description.

This is where you should you know what? fuck those other pc makers. looking back over history, I blame them for a lot of the bad stuff. XP was a mess. It was not only unsecure (old windows code), but outdated (see: XP can't ready HDD capacity properly). MS re-wrote a lot of underlying code for security reasons, and these pc/accessory makers didn't release driver compatability updates fast enough, leaving MS with egg on their face about "vista being crap". then, their response to this was to blame vista, and fart aroun. The Lenovo Yoga Book is one of the most innovative devices we've ever tested, and it's great for note taking, but its Halo keyboard is definitely not for touch typists.
